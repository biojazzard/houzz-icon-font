#Houzz-icon-font

This is just a font icon to *temporarily* supplement [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) with a [Houzz](http://houzz.com) icon since it's been [requested](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/2039) *many* times.

Hopefully it will be added to Font Awesome soon, but in the mean time this seems to be working well for me.

## Thanks

I wanted to give a **big thanks** to [@endtwist](https://github.com/endtwist) and [@kaizau](https://github.com/kaizau) for their awesome work on [FontCustom](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom). FontCustom made this *super* fucking easy.
